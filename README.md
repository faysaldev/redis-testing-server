# Redis-based Express API with Caching

This project demonstrates a basic Express server that integrates with Redis to cache API responses and perform other Redis operations (e.g., lists, key-value storage). The project includes functionality to cache API data, manage Redis lists, and interact with Redis key-value pairs.

## Project Overview

- **Express Server**: A simple server that provides caching functionality using Redis.
- **Redis Caching**: Stores the posts from an external API (`jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`) in Redis for faster subsequent access.
- **Redis List Operations**: Implements list operations like pushing and retrieving data from a Redis list.
- **Redis Key-Value Operations**: Retrieves multiple key-value pairs from Redis using the `mget` command.

### Technologies Used:

- **Node.js** (Express)
- **ioredis** (Redis client)
- **axios** (for API requests)
- **Redis** (for caching and list operations)
